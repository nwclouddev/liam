Worksafe!

- WO should all have a Safe Task Plan (STP) before a job can start
- STPs should be built ahead of time for most maintenance situations - an ST should be able to pull up the sheet of music they need when a job comes their way
- STPs available to STs should be available in a "Library"
    - STPs will need to be associated in a "join" table of event_task_steps
